This project has two parts:

- Revise your fallers program (discuss with your partner and
  pick one of your fallers implementations that will form
  the basis of your new project).

- Add test cases to [the AVL code from the video (with some
  changed names)](avl.rkt) and then implement
  `rebalance-right`. Make sure you have (at least) complete
  coverage before you start on `rebalance-right`.
